**🧑‍🚀 Astronaut Knowledge – Flip, Learn & Explore Space Legends**

**🔭 Introduction**

Astronaut Knowledge is a fully interactive, educational web experience that presents information about famous astronauts using dynamic flip cards. Designed to be fun, fast, and informative, the project offers a hands-on way for users to discover the achievements, missions, and stories of space explorers.

Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project is lightweight and responsive — no backend, no APIs, and no frameworks required.

**💡 What It Offers**

✅ A clean, responsive grid layout with astronaut flip cards

✅ 10 astronauts, each with a custom card showing their:

Name & Nationality

Missions participated in

Achievements or historic firsts

Fun facts or memorable quotes

✅ Flip animation: Clicking or hovering reveals the backside with details

✅ Emoji-based avatars or minimal illustrations for a lightweight interface

**🧑‍🏫 Use Cases**

📚 Education: Great for schools, science teachers, and student demos

🌌 Space Enthusiasts: Easy way to remember iconic space missions and astronauts

💻 Portfolio/Web Dev Practice: Showcases clean layout, interactivity, and animation

🎓 Hackathons or Web Challenges: Quick, beautiful, and complete project

**⚙️ Tools & Tech Used**

HTML5: Markup structure

CSS3: Styling, card layout, and 3D flip animation

JavaScript: Minor interaction logic

No API / No Framework: Fully frontend and deployable via GitHub Pages or Netlify

🌠 Why It Stands Out
This project is simple but powerful — it's a fun way to explore space history without complex data or backend systems. You get an engaging experience that works instantly, loads fast, and runs anywhere — even offline if needed.

Whether you're teaching, learning, or just browsing space legends, Astronaut Knowledge is a compact window into the human side of space exploration.
